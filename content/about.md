My name is Michele Adduci and I'm a Computer Engineer located in Berlin, Germany.

Being never done learning, being able to think big and see the _big picture_, improving myself and staying curious have marked my 10 years in tech. Working on challenging projects, using cutting-edge technologies and adopting high quality standards for the design and delivery of solutions has enabled me to gain experience and expertise in accomplishing customers' goals with the right quality and in a timely fashion.

### Contents of this blog

These Web pages contain thoughts and references about my interests: Project Management, Distributed Systems, Software Architecture, DevOps and Software Development.

I enjoy to share my researches with others who might encounter problems I've already solved or for which I've found a potential solution, avoiding the classic _reinventing the wheel_, in pure engineering way.

I'm open to feedbacks and discussions on published themes and to critics which can help improving this blog.
