This website doesn't use cookies and it is actually **tracker and Javascript-free**. So, what's the purpose of this page? It's really simple: you've noticed you haven't seen any popup dialog asking you for those annoying GDPR consents. 

No external trackers, no externalized resources (fonts, images, etc.): I **do not track** or store any user information, but still you might want to navigate anonymously with your browser, since Netlify (the hosting service for this website) can still track your IP address.
